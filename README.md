### DISCLAIMER
Please feel free to reuse code as you need, though I don't recommend it if you don't understand what it does (or better, WHY it does).
I took pieces from many projects, mostly ideas, but sometimes code for the parts I couldn't write originally.
I regretted it, and went back to relearn all the code/theory behind the code.
If this is you, I recommend asking questions first. Ask me, I won't send you to google, or tell you it's a duplicate thread lol.
